# Use Case

**Title:** Determining the health of a Github repository  

**Primary Actor:** Project Leader 

**Goal in Context:** The project lead is able to assess if an open source project is healthly enough for its company's standards to incorporate into their product  

**Stakeholders:**  
* Project Lead: To understand if software is appropriate to incorporate into their own product
* Developer: To clearly gauge if a piece of software will need to be maintained by them or if it's reliable
* Manager: To access the longevity of this project with regards to dependencies

**Preconditions:**  
* Metrics for a healthy repository are already defined
* The repositories to be compared are already picked out 

**Main Success Scenario:** Project lead understands the metrics presented and makes an accurate decision if the software should be incoporated  

**Failed End Conditions:** Project lead receives little to no information on the health of the chosen repository  

**Trigger:** Project lead is assigned to a brand new project and needs to assess what libraries and dependencies should be used
